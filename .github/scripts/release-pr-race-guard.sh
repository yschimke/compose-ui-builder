# Keep a release-please PR pass from running while a release is still publishing.
#
# Ported from yschimke/compose-ai-tools (.github/scripts/release-pr-race-guard.sh), where #4645
# was the first PR it would have prevented. Keep the copies in step.
#
# Why this exists. release-please's PR half baselines on the latest PUBLISHED GitHub Release.
# This repository cuts releases as DRAFTS (release-please-config.json `"draft": true`) and only
# un-drafts them once the release has uploaded. For that whole window the version main already
# carries in `.release-please-manifest.json` is invisible to release-please, so a PR pass falls
# back to older history: it opens a release PR whose notes list every commit since the last
# release it CAN see -- in a repository whose earlier releases are drafts too, every commit back
# to the bootstrap -- and the PR stays like that until the next push to main recomputes it.
#
# The release run itself is kept out of that trap by `skip-github-pull-request` on its cutting
# invocation, with `update-release-pr` running the PR half only after the release is published.
# What that cannot stop is a DIFFERENT run doing the PR half while the release is in flight. So
# this guard answers one question -- is a release in flight? -- and the job asks it twice:
#
#   MODE=check   before running release-please, which skips the common case where the push run
#                starts after the merge; and
#   MODE=repair  after, which closes the window the pre-flight check cannot: the merge can land
#                mid-invocation. If a release went in flight while release-please was computing,
#                whatever it just opened re-proposes the version being released, so we close it
#                and let the release run open the right PR from the published baseline.
#
# In flight means: the version in `.release-please-manifest.json` on main has no PUBLISHED
# release. `releases/tags/<tag>` deliberately does not resolve drafts, so "no published release"
# covers both halves of the window -- before the draft is cut, and while it is still a draft.
#
# Fail open, always. Every unreadable answer (a manifest we cannot fetch, an API that errors) is
# treated as "no release in flight", and a version that has sat unpublished for longer than
# STALE_AFTER_MINUTES is treated as stranded rather than in flight. A guard that failed closed
# would silently stop the release PR from being updated at all -- a much worse failure than the
# stale PR it exists to prevent.
#
# Usage:
#   MODE=check  GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo GH_TOKEN=… release-pr-race-guard.sh
#   MODE=repair RP_PR='{"number":123}' GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo GH_TOKEN=… release-pr-race-guard.sh
#
# Outputs (GITHUB_OUTPUT): `in_flight`/`version` in check mode, `raced`/`closed` in repair mode.
