# Decide which modules a release actually has to publish to Maven Central.
#
# Every release used to publish all coordinates at the tag, whether or not a byte of them changed:
# 19 releases (v3.30.0 to v3.48.0) uploaded ~2,100 files, the largest source of Central uploads
# without selective publishing (#247). Ported from yschimke/compose-ai-tools'
# `.github/scripts/maven-publish-plan.sh`, minus that repository's `gradle-plugin` included build.
#
# A module is published when:
#
#   1. a file under it changed since the tag IT last published at (not since the last release -
#      a module skipped for three releases is compared against its own baseline, so nothing is
#      ever missed by a gap), or
#   2. a module it depends on is being published, or
#   3. a shared build input changed, which can move every artifact at once, or
#   4. the version catalog changed an entry its own build script uses (see SHARED below: a catalog
#      entry that a shared build file uses is rule 3 instead, and publishes everything).
#
# Rules 3 and 4 skip `build-logic/src/test/**` and whole-line comment/whitespace edits to shared
# Kotlin files. Tested by `test-maven-publish-plan.sh`.
#
# Rule 2 is what keeps the POMs honest, and it is deliberately coarser than it needs to be. A
# published POM names its project dependencies at *their* `project.version`, so a module may only
# be skipped while everything it depends on is also skipped; otherwise it would name a sibling
# version that was never uploaded.
#
# The BOM is not a module here. It publishes whenever this plan is non-empty, and never when it is
# empty (`printPublishTasks` in the root build), and it constrains every skipped coordinate at the
# version recorded in the manifest (`PublishedVersions`).
#
# Every uncertainty resolves to "publish". Central refuses a second upload of a version, so an
# unnecessary publish costs quota while a wrongly-skipped one is unrepairable.
#
# Usage: maven-publish-plan.sh --head <ref> [--manifest <path>]
# Output: one artifact id per line, on stdout. Diagnostics go to stderr.
